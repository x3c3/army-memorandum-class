## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- `[digsig]` class option: enables an interactive PDF digital signature field in the signature block, positioned above the signer name line and aligned to the signature block indent
- Bundled `digsig.sty` v2.3 (2022-03-31, MIT, Martin Lottermoser) -- provides `\digsigfield` macro via hyperref extension
- `examples/digsig.sty` symlink so examples compile without TEXINPUTS changes
- `examples/example-sig.tex` -- new example demonstrating the `[digsig]` option with a custom logo
- `\enclsnocount`: new command for unnumbered enclosure list (AR 25-50 Figure 4-4)

### Fixed
- `\enclsnocount` command -- suppresses enclosure count per AR 25-50 Figure 4-4
- `SUBJECT:` line now uses double-space per AR 25-50 1-17
- Added `\brokenpenalty=10000` to prevent hyphenation across page breaks

### Changed

- Removed `\frenchspacing` -- 4 OCT 24 update: 1-39.b.(9) two spaces after
  sentences. *The space between sentences in LaTeX is stretchy anyway, and
  there's hardly any visible difference between the two. This restores the
  default behavior.* See discussion: https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/4705
- 4 OCT 24 update: 1-19. Leaders can direct fonts and formatting. -- Font
  default changed from Arial to Times New Roman Following IG guidance for Army
  Senior leaders (below). Can be overridden by placing `\setmainfont{Arial}` in
  the preamble.  As cited at  https://ig.army.mil/Portals/101/Documents/IG%20Training%20Documents/DAIG_2025%20Correspondence%20and%20Reports%20Guide_web.pdf?ver=tD5_JdJC9pYy11ki077Fow%3D%3D

    > As of May 2024, all correspondence addressed to the Top 4 Army Senior leaders (Secretary,
    > Under Secretary, Chief of Staff, and Vice Chief of Staff) will adhere to the standards issued by
    > Executive Communications and Control (ECC). In particular, this includes the use of Times New
    > Roman in all communications (except the letterhead itself, which remains in Arial).

- Refactored `\am@encls` to proper if/else chain
